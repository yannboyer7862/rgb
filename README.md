This is the repository of RGB(Rust GameBoy).



It's very WIP GameBoy emulator written in Rust.



(for now, nothing boots, as the project started very recently : April 9th)



This emulator won't be the most accurate one, I just want to have fun.



WARNING: I'm developing the emulator on my linux system, it might work on macOS and Windows but I'm not too sure.




Feel free to follow the progress of the project if you're interested. :D



If you discover any bug you can open a GitHub issue I'll see what I can do.



This project is also a great exercise to improve my Rust skills, I rarely use this language.
